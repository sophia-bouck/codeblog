      <p>This assignment was very familiar to me because I already have some html experience. My biggest challenge was getting github set up, specifically cloning the repo in terminal and all the git commands.</p>
      <p>This assignment taught me how to use github. I already knew how to use basic commands in the terminal like opening a directory and I already had a basic understanding of html.</p>
      <p>I looked up the syntax for specific tags in html on w3schools.com to refresh my memory and googled how to link atom to the terminal.</p>

      <h3>assignment 2 - 4/20/22</h3>
      <p>The most challenging this for this assignment was aligning and formatting each element. For example, aligning something to the right or adding margins or padding. </p>
      <p>I learned how to use CSS. As I went along things became more and more clear. I didn't know barely anything going in because I've only done inline styling before.</p>
      <p>I played the flexbox frog game which really helped. I also looked up everything on w3schools.com again for syntax and properties.</p>
      <p>I had to google borders and button styling to complete this assignment. But there was a lot more too.</p>
