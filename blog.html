      <h3>assignment 1 - 3/30/22</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>This assignment was very familiar to me because I already have some html experience. My biggest challenge was getting github set up, specifically cloning the repo in terminal and all the git commands.</p>
      <p>This assignment taught me how to use github. I already knew how to use basic commands in the terminal like opening a directory and I already had a basic understanding of html.</p>
      <p>I looked up the syntax for specific tags in html on w3schools.com to refresh my memory and googled how to link atom to the terminal.</p>

      <h3>assignment 2 - 4/20/22</h3>
      <p>The most challenging this for this assignment was aligning and formatting each element. For example, aligning something to the right or adding margins or padding. </p>
      <p>I learned how to use CSS. As I went along things became more and more clear. I didn't know barely anything going in because I've only done inline styling before.</p>
      <p>I played the flexbox frog game which really helped. I also looked up everything on w3schools.com again for syntax and properties.</p>
      <p>I had to google borders and button styling to complete this assignment. But there was a lot more too.</p>

      <h3>assignment 3 - 5/9/22</h3>
      <p>This assignment was incredibly hard for me. I felt like I didn't give myself enough time and that my confidence was incredibly low. I had problems with syntax and understanding the basics of javascript because it is entirely new to me. I did a lot of googling and rewatched parts of lectures to try and understand. </p>
      <p>Going into this I knew nothing. I learned javascript basics and how to use the console. I'm more used to C type languages so this type of language was very forgein to me.</p>
      <p>I googled a lot for this assignment, mostly about the details of certain functions and basics. I watched a lot of videos including the lectures as well as youtube videos.</p>
      <p>I had to specifically look up createElement, and all the errors I got along the way in order to fix them.</p>

    <h3>assignment 4 - 5/16/22</h3>
    <p>This assignment was fairly quick but required me to review lots of material to complete. </p>
    <p>I learned about servers and hosting webpages myself which I've never done before. I knew almost nothing going in other than the basics of javascript because of assignment 3.</p>
    <p>To complete this assignment I pretty much just watched the lectures over and reviewed the node js and js modules. I followed along with the class on how to initially host the server which was very helpful.</p>
    <p>I had to google to figure out why my css wasn't loading in my page. The error ended up being a typo.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- <p><a href="#" class = "link">assignment 4 : node.js</a></p> -->

  <div>
  <h3>assignment 5 - 5/31/22</h3>
  <p>This assignment was tough because the way to do everything wasn't incredibly intuitive for me. I solved most of my problems by referencing the lecture recordings. </p>
  <p>I learned about templatizing webpages and more about how servers work. With this assignment I think I got more of a feel about how an actual webpage would be setup. I already knew a lot of the syntax for the javascript from the previous assignments.</p>
  <p>To complete this assignment I rewatched the lectures while following along in my own code.</p>
  <p>I had to google some error messages and some details on how to take in an argument from a link for the last section of the assignment.</p>
