    <h3>assignment 1 - 3/30/22</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>This assignment was very familiar to me because I already have some html experience. My biggest challenge was getting github set up, specifically cloning the repo in terminal and all the git commands.</p>
    <p>This assignment taught me how to use github. I already knew how to use basic commands in the terminal like opening a directory and I already had a basic understanding of html.</p>
    <p>I looked up the syntax for specific tags in html on w3schools.com to refresh my memory and googled how to link atom to the terminal.</p>
